<H1>Cartoon</H1>

<div><p>A cartoon is a form of two-dimensional illustrated visual art. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic drawing or painting intended 
for satire, caricature, or humor, or to the artistic style of such works.<u> An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.</u> </p></div>

<div><p>The concept originated in the Middle Ages and first described a preparatory drawing for a <i>piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry,</i> or stained glass window. In the 19th century,
 it came to refer to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers, and after the early 20th century, it referred to comic strips and animated films.</p></div>

<div><p>Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over the cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by painters, such as the Raphael Cartoons in London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, 
are highly prized in their own right.<b> Tapestry cartoons</b>, usually coloured, were followed with the eye by the weavers on the loom.</p></div>

<div><p> Cartoon (from Italian:<i> cartone and Dutch:</i> kartonâ€”words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a study or modello for a painting, stained glass or tapestry. Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes,
 to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days (giornate).</p></div>
<H3>Print media</H3>
 
 <div><p>In modern print media, a cartoon is a piece of art, <b > usually humorous in intent.</b> This usage dates from 1843, when Punch magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages, particularly sketches by John Leech. 
 The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new Palace of Westminster.</p></div>
